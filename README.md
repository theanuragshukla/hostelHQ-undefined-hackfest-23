# HostelHQ
A hostel management system written in `PERN` Stack. This was our project submisssion for  `HackFest-23` organized by `IEEE`, which was a 24 hours hackathon and we were supposed to be awake all night and finish the project.

## Progress
In this section, the progress % is only about the implementation, and does not indicate other factors like optimisation, clean code, etc.

- Frontend 100%
- Backend ~80%
- Integration 50%

## Result
we lost

## Reasons for above result
- we couldn't deliver a finished project, because the problem statement was big and we took it seriously.
- The judges asked for features that were not mentioned in Problem statement
  - like, how a student will notify the cook, that he will not be eating today ?
- They didn't care about backend and databases at all and only looked at the UI
- The winners didn't have a backend and won with a simple website written using `HTML` and `CSS`

## Experiences
- Don't take PS seriously
- Focus on UI
- BE and DB doesn't matter for a 24hrs hackathon (maybe)
